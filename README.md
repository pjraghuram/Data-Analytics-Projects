## 📊 Project 1: Crime Data Analysis 

**Notebook**: `ie6400-project1-fall2024.ipynb`  
**Description**:  
This project explores crime incidents in Los Angeles from 2020 to the present. The dataset is sourced from [LA Open Data](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8/about_data) and is used to understand temporal and geographic crime patterns using EDA and visualization.

**Key Techniques**:
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Crime trend visualization
- Geo-spatial filtering

## 🚗 Project 2: Crash Reporting Analysis 

**Notebook**: `ie6600-project-1.ipynb`  
**Description**:  
This project focuses on analyzing crash data to identify key patterns related to driver demographics, time of accident, and types of violations. The dataset includes various attributes such as driver age, crash severity, and vehicle involvement.

**Key Techniques**:
- Data acquisition and inspection
- Statistical analysis
- Categorization of crash types
- Time-based crash analysis

## 🔍 Project 3: Driver Behavior & Collision Insights

**Notebook**: `ie6600-project-3.ipynb`  
**Description**:  
A continuation and extension of Project 2, this project dives deeper into analyzing driver behavior, licensing patterns, and correlation with crash severity and frequency. Data visualizations are used to present findings clearly.

**Key Techniques**:
- Data aggregation and grouping
- Correlation analysis
- Visualization with seaborn and matplotlib
- Behavioral segmentation
